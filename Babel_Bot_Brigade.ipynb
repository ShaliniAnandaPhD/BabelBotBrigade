        "Introduction: The provided codes represent various multi-agent systems and simulations, encompassing predictive models built on machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, as well as custom-built agents for specific tasks. These systems can operate both collaboratively and competitively, demonstrating different prediction strategies. Models or agents are used for tasks such as material property prediction, product quality control, or evaluating composite material designs. Key aspects of these systems include loading and saving models, fitting data, making predictions based on different model types, and handling multi-agent simulation tasks. This wide range of applications demonstrates the flexibility and power of multi-agent systems in addressing complex prediction tasks.**\n",

        "3. A scikit-learn LinearRegression model trained on usage_data and saved as usage_model.pkl\n",
        "4. Another scikit-learn LinearRegression model trained on reliability_data and saved as a JSON file reliability_model.json\n",

        "- Generate synthetic training data using numpy.random.rand()\n",
        "- Define model architecture (Keras Sequential, PyTorch nn.Sequential, scikit-learn LinearRegression)\n",
        "- Train model by fitting on data\n",
        "- Save trained model weights/parameters to file using native save APIs or pickle/JSON for portability\n",
        "This allows training and saving models in different frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn. Saving the models preserves the trained weights and parameters so the models can be reloaded later for inference.\n",
